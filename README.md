# Denver Code Club Weekly Projects
## jQuery Hotshot - 10 weeks / 10 jQuery Projects

###What This Is For

Each week at the [Denver Code Club Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Code-Club/) we complete one chapter out of [Dan Wellman's jQuery Hotshot book](http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-hotshot/book) published by Packt Publishing. The code that **I write** is in 'matt-completed.js' in each chapter folder.

My files are **heavily** commented. I do this so that I can understand line-by-line what the code is exactly doing.

I'll update this repo each week as I go along. If you're a member of Denver Code Club you can look at my comments in 'matt-completed.js' to better understand what's happening. You should be commenting up your files as well.

###File Structure

To see working demos of all of the projects please run the HTML files
in the 'Chapter code' directory.

The code in the 'Reference code' directory does not run, it is
provided for reference to easily isolate the files used by each project.
